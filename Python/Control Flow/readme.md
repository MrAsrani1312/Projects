## Control Flow - If Statements in Python


#### Syntax: 
```python
if condition:
	<Statements>
elif condition:
	<Statements>
else:
	<Statements>
``` 

The `if` statement executes if the condition in it is *TRUE*. 

The `elif` condition is short for `else if` and is used to make an if-else ladder for checking multiple statements. 

Finally, the `else` statement is executed if the other conditions are not satisfied.
